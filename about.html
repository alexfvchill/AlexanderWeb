                    <p>I’m a third-year college student at Aurora State College, studying Information Technology. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by technology and how it shapes the way we live. That curiosity led me to this path, where I’m constantly learning and discovering new ways to improve and innovate.

                        Outside of academics, volleyball has been a big part of my life. It’s more than just a sport to me—it has taught me discipline, resilience, and the value of teamwork. Through wins and losses, I’ve learned how to push forward, adapt, and grow, lessons that I carry with me in every aspect of life.
                        
                        My goal is simple: to finish my studies and use what I’ve learned to make a real difference. I want to contribute to technology in a way that benefits people, whether by creating solutions, improving systems, or simply sharing knowledge. I know the road ahead won’t always be easy, but I’m ready to take on the challenges, keep learning, and strive for something greater.
